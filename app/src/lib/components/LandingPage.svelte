				Ever thought of using Twitch to show off your coding skills? You might already be doing it.
				What if you send a link to your stream in your job applications? How will you know
				recruiters visited your stream?
			</p>

			<p>
				trq (Twitch Recruit) lets you create a clean page of your Twitch stream with relevant
				information. If recruiters catch you live, they can chat directly without logging in.

				search, but we are here to find out xD)
